# Programming-Related Learnings
The most relevant learnings from programming-related subjects include:

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Understanding how to efficiently store and manipulate data, as well as solve complex problems.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**: Mastering OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to write reusable, modular, and maintainable code.
- **Version Control Systems (VCS)**: Familiarity with VCS tools like Git and GitHub is essential for collaborative development, tracking changes, and managing different versions of codebases.
- **Design Patterns and Principles**: Knowledge of design patterns and principles (e.g., SOLID principles or Iterator pattern) helps to design scalable, flexible, and maintainable software systems.

# Teamwork and Conflict Resolution
In the final project of my degree, two members had differing opinions on how to organize the sprints, reviews, and demos, so we:

- **Communicated Openly**: We discussed the issue openly in a special daily, ensuring each member understood the other's perspective in order to reach a common agreement.
- **Evaluated Options**: We objectively evaluated the pros and cons of each proposed implementation.
- **Found a Compromise**: We made a deal and reached a common ground.

# Personal Learning Plans and Development Expectations

- **Expanding Technical Skills**: Continuing to learn new programming languages, frameworks, and technologies to stay on the state of the art.
- **Improving Soft Skills**: Enhancing communication, teamwork, and leadership skills to effectively collaborate with and manage diverse teams.
