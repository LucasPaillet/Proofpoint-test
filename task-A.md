# Programming-Related Learnings
- **Data Structures**: understanding how to efficiently store and manipulate the data in different problems, knowing the pros and contras of using an estructure against other.
- **Algorithms**: knowledge of different algorithms (such as sorting) and Big O notation can help achieve efficient, understandable, and easily modifiable solutions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: mastering principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism will help write reusable, modular, and maintainable code and classes. This principles can be extrapolated outside the POO (and in almost any situation), whick makes them very important in the IT world.
- **Version Control Systems**: familiarity with tools like Git and GitHub is essential for collaborative development, tracking changes, and managing different versions of codebases.
- **Design Patterns and Principles**: capability to design and implement patterns and principles (e.g., SOLID principles or Iterator pattern) helps to develop scalable, flexible, and maintainable software

# Teamwork and Conflict Resolution
In the final project of my degree, two members had differing opinions on how to organize our SCRUM (dailys, sprints, reviews, and demos), so we discussed the issue openly in a special daily, ensuring each member understood the other's perspective in order to reach a common agreement. After an objectively evaluation of the pros and cons of each proposed implementation we made a deal and reached a common ground

# Personal Learning Plans and Development Expectations

- **Expanding Technical Skills**: continuing to improve (and adquire new) capabilities in programming languages, frameworks, and technologies to stay on the state of the art.
- **Improving Soft Skills**: enhancing communication, teamwork, and leadership skills to effectively collaborate with and manage diverse teams.
- **Working in a formal environment**: working alongside a team contributes much more to professional development due to everything that it entails interacting with others and following company rules.
